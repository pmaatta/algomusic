Top priority:
- split generate_music functions into smaller functions
- lower probability for diatonic transpositions of a third; higher for 4ths, 5ths, 2nds
- fix rhythm/tempo usage
  - note amounts, start times, durations related
- harmonize existing pattern
- arpeggio: 
  - pitches sequential
  - root note connected to other patterns
- harmony + bass connection
- gentype 1,2
  - 2: same instruments
  - 'merge' 1 and 2: generate chord prog, generate pattern(s), mutate based on chord


Normal priority:
- gentype 4:
  - sections
  - modulate chord prog
- add/remove instruments 
- beat generator
  - choose note amount, pattern length & evenly divide notes into pattern
- add / drop out / reintroduce patterns / instruments
- edit existing midi
- extend existing midi?
- note durations
- different scales overlapping
- overlapping patterns of different length
- triplet / other subdivisions, other time signatures
- solid chord prog + free markov chain melody + drum beat w/ variation
- communication between patterns
- non-spicy modes for major
- arpeggiator
  - random chords, more / less extensions
  - leaps vs no leaps
  - beat & bassline
- riffs
  - fifths
- rhythmic complexity
- unison / duplicate pattern
- structure
  - question & answer phrases
  - metapatterns: repeat / vary collections of patterns


Low priority:
- "In C" idea
- tonal / modal
- chromatic notes, borrowed chords
- modulation
  - key change jumping distribution


Music gen idea:
0. Take in parameters (initial tempo, key, time signature etc)
--
1. Choose instruments (pattern types)
2. Generate chord progression of length L (number of chords / bars), choose chord progression repeat amount R
3. Generate drum patterns (1-2 bars), repeat for L*R bars
4. Generate bass & harmony parts, repeat R times
    - varying pattern to conform to a new scale optional
5. Generate background melody parts
    - varying pattern to conform to a new scale necessary
5. Generate lead melody part(s)
    - overarching structure; different approach from Pattern needed
