Top priority:
- lower probability for diatonic transpositions of a third; higher for 4ths, 5ths, 2nds
- fix rhythm/tempo usage
  - note amounts, start times, durations related
- harmonize existing pattern
- arpeggio: 
  - pitches sequential
  - root note connected to other patterns
- harmony + bass connection
- gentype 1,2
  - 2: same instruments
  - 'merge' 1 and 2: generate chord prog, generate pattern(s), mutate based on chord


Normal priority:
- beat generator
  - choose note amount, pattern length & evenly divide notes into pattern
- add / drop out / reintroduce patterns / instruments
- edit existing midi
- extend existing midi?
- note durations
- different scales overlapping
- overlapping patterns of different length
- triplet / other subdivisions, other time signatures
- solid chord prog + free markov chain melody + drum beat w/ variation
- communication between patterns
- non-spicy modes for major
- arpeggiator
  - random chords, more / less extensions
  - leaps vs no leaps
  - beat & bassline
- riffs
  - fifths
- rhythmic complexity
- unison / duplicate pattern
- structure
  - question & answer phrases
  - metapatterns: repeat / vary collections of patterns


Low priority:
- "In C" idea
- tonal / modal
- chromatic notes, borrowed chords
- modulation
  - key change jumping distribution
